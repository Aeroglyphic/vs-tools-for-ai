## Project templates

OpenMind Studio provide the following project templates:

1.  "From Existing Python code" template for creating applications by importing existing Python files in a folder.

1.  "Caffe2 Python Application" template for creating Caffe2 applications with Python language.

1.  "CNTK BrainScript Application" template for creating CNTK applications with BrainScript language.

1.  "CNTK Python Application" template for creating CNTK applications with Python language.

1.  "Keras Application (CNTK backend)" template for creating Keras applications with Python language using CNTK backend.

1.  "Keras Application (TensorFlow backend)" template for creating Keras applications with Python language using TensorFlow backend.

1.  "Keras Application (Theano backend)" template for creating Keras applications with Python language using Theano backend.

1.  "TensorFlow Application" template for creating TensorFlow applications with Python language.

1.  "Theano Application" template for creating Theano applications with Python language.

## Create New Projects from Templates <a id="create_new_project"></a>

To create a new OpenMind project, go to ***File &gt; New &gt; Project***.
On the left explorer pane, OpenMind projects can be found under ***Installed-&gt; Templates-&gt;OpenMind***.

    a. "Search Paths": users could specify additional directories which are added to Python sys.path for making libraries available for importing.
    
    b. "Script Arguments": command line arguments to be passed into the application on project start.

    c. "Interpreter Arguments": command line arguments to be passed to the interpreter.

    d. "Interpreter Path": the interpreter which is used to start the project.

    e. "Environment Variables": this Specifies environment variables to be set in the spawned process in the form:

        NAME1=value1
        NAME2=value2
        â€¦

    f. "Enable native code debugging": users could debug into native code written by C/C++.

1.  "Publish" property page:

    a. "Backend": users could switch to another backend.

### Include multiple projects in a Solution <a id="include_multiple_projects"></a>

To add a new project to the solution, right-click on the solution in the ***Solution Explorer*** and select ***Add***.

A Startup Project runs alongside a solution, and the startup script in the startup project will be executed.

### Include multiple scripts in one project <a id="include_multiple_scripts"></a>

To create a new script within a project, right-click on the project in Solution Explorer and select ***Add &gt; New Item***. To add an existing script to a OpenMind project, right-click on the project and select ***Add &gt; Existing Item***.

Users set one of the scripts as the startup script by right-clicking it and select "**Set as Startup File**". The startup file serves as the main entry of the whole project. E.g. when users press F5 to run a project, the startup script is executed. The startup file node uses bolding font.
